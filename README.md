# NBA-Shot-Selection-Analysis

This report describes the relationship between shot selection and NBA team performance. The goal of this analysis is to determine if a higher volume of three-point attempts correlates with improved success in the NBA categorized by these key performance metrics: win percentage, points per game, and offensive rating. Utilizing a regression model, we analyzed shot data from recent NBA seasons to discover the impact of shot distribution from three main zones (three-point, mid-range, paint) on team performance.

The NBA landscape is evolving with a growing emphasis on three-point shooting. Recent success of teams like the Boston Celtics, who heavily emphasized three-point shooting, motivates this investigation. Findings from this project could provide valuable insights for NBA coaches on optimizing shot selection strategies to improve team performance.
