# NBA-Shot-Selection-Analysis

This report examines the relationship between shot selection and NBA team performance with a focus on determining whether a higher volume of three-point attempts correlates with improved success, which was measured using these key performance metrics: win percentage, points per game, and offensive rating. Using data from recent NBA seasons, we analyzed the impact of shot distribution across three primary zones (three-point, mid-range, paint) on team performance. We developed several statistical models in R-Studio and determined the best one using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which estimates the quality of each model. By conducting a t-test on the most effective regression model, we were able to identify the most significant predictor for the model. Motivated by the recent success of teams heavily emphasizing three-point shooting, this investigation explores the evolving NBA landscape where three-pointers plays an increasingly crucial role. Findings from this project could provide valuable insights for NBA coaches on optimizing shot selection strategies to ultimately improve team performance.
